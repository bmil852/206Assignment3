README

Voxspell is a simple program designed to test spelling ability. It provides
multiple difficulties to enable the evaluation of a wide range of spelling 
skills.

1. Installation:
	
In Linux, ensure that you have both Festival and the voice akl_nz_jdt_diphone
installed. Also, a Java version of 1.7 or greater must be present on your system.

To run Voxspell, simply execute VoxspellPrototype.jar.

2. Program Instructions:

Main Menu:
When Voxspell starts, you will be presented with 2 options. Click "Begin Quiz"
to start a new quiz, or press the gear in the top right to view the settings.
The first time you start a quiz, you will be asked which level you would like to
start from. Choose one from the drop-down menu and press "OK" to continue, or
"Back" to go back to the main menu.

Settings:
In this menu you are able to change the voice Voxspell speaks to you in. Simply
choose a voice you like from the drop-down menu. Click the back button to return
to the main menu.

Quiz Select:
In this menu you are able to choose the level of difficulty you would like to be
tested on, starting from the level you previously selected. To unlock higher levels,
you must first complete a spelling test from the previous level with an accuracy of
90% or higher. Whether you have previously passed or failed a test is displayed next
to each level, as well as your overall accuracy for each level.

Quiz:
Here your spelling will be tested on a 10 random words from your selected level. The
program will ask you to spell a particular word, and you can attempt to spell it by 
typing your answer in the central textbox. Click the arrow button or press "enter" 
on your keyboard to submit your answer. If you get it wrong, you will have the
opportunity to try again, however this second attempt will not affect your accuracy
for the test. If you wish for the word to be repeated, then click the microphone
button above the text field. Your progress in the test is displayed at the bottom
of the window.

If you are able to achieve an accuracy of 90% or greater in a particular test, then
you will be rewarded with video you can view. Strive for 100% to receive an
additional video!
